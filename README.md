## Installation
Make sure you have node installed on your device. If installed, clone this repo from my github (HuckleBun) onto your machine. Using your terminal, move into the directory that you have cloned. Once inside the directory, run the command 'node index.js', and it will begin to prompt you with questions to answer. Once finished, you should see a new file within this directory called 'README'txt'. You are all done!

## Usage
This project allows the user to create a professional README for their projects with just a few simple questions to answer.
